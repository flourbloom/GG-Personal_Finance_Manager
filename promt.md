try to use less tokens

Dont forget to style the ui 

So look at the transaction tab of the sidebar

And the add transaction button

it shows the category that we can select.

So can u make a new category called Goals 

When selecting that Category. it will ask user to select what wallet they gonna use to do the transaction. 

Then after doing the transaction it will create a transaction record in the transaction tab.

and now in the Goals tab. each goals has a contribute button. 

change the pop up after clicking to. it will ask user to select what wallet they gonna use to contrubute (use the same pop up but assume goals category is already pressed from the eariler feature.)
